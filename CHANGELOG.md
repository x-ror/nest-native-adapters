# Changelog

Both packages, `nestjs-adapter-node` and `nestjs-adapter-bun`, share one
version and one changelog. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

First npm release. Supported baseline: NestJS 12.1.2, Node.js 22+, Bun 1.4+.

### Added

- `NodeHttpAdapter` (`node:http`) and `BunHttpAdapter` (`Bun.serve`) for real
  Nest: routing, middleware, guards, pipes, interceptors, filters and DI.
- JSON, URL-encoded and multipart bodies, opt-in text/raw parsers, raw bodies,
  `FileInterceptor` and friends with Multer's memory-storage file shape.
- All Nest versioning types, native HTTPS via `httpsOptions`, `@Sse()`,
  `res.write()` streaming, `@Render()` with Express-compatible engines,
  WebSocket gateways (Node: Nest's adapters; Bun: `BunWsAdapter`).
- CORS with the `cors` package's options and headers.
- Nest's cookie API, Express-style `res.cookie()` / `res.clearCookie()`, and
  compatibility with `cookie-parser`.
- Express's `trust proxy` semantics through the `trustProxy` option or
  `app.set("trust proxy", …)`, with `req.ip`, `req.ips`, `req.protocol` and
  `req.hostname`.
- `useStaticAssets()` like `express.static()`: validators, `304`/`412`, byte
  ranges, `maxAge`, dotfiles, redirects and streamed files.
- Graceful `close()`, `shutdownTimeout`, `forceCloseConnections` and
  `return503OnClosing`.
- `req.secure`, `req.host` and `req.subdomains` as on Express, with the
  `subdomain offset` setting.
- Response events (`finish`, `close`) and native HTTPS on Bun too.

### Fixed (from pre-release builds)

- On Bun, a request with a missing or invalid Host header (for which Bun
  passes a bare `/path` URL) was routed with its first path segment cut off,
  so `/x/admin` reached `/admin`. Such requests now route by their own path.

### Changed (from pre-release builds)

- CORS follows the `cors` package: `origin: true` reflects the request origin,
  an `undefined` origin disables CORS, every `OPTIONS` request is a preflight
  unless `preflightContinue`, and `Vary` is appended. See the README's CORS
  section for the full list.
- `req.cookies` and `req.signedCookies` are left to `cookie-parser`, as on
  Express.
- Static `maxAge` is in milliseconds, as on Express (it was seconds).
